# NeuralNet
A Brief Project Summary

During the course of this project, I’ve written a neural net with the ability to perform the following assignment tasks
Learn the AND boolean expression to an accuracy of 100% in 85 epochs with a learning rate of 1.0 and the use of 2 hidden neurons
Learn the XOR boolean expression to an accuracy of 100% in around 25,000-40,000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 2 hidden neurons. 
Learn to classify digits from the Alpaydin and Kaynak’s Handwritten Digits set to a validation accuracy of around 97% and a testing accuracy of around 96% in 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 150 hidden neurons
Learn to classify digits from the MNIST Handwritten Digits set to a validation accuracy of around 91% in 5 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 150 hidden neurons
