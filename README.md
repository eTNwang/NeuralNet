# NeuralNet
This Neural Net Has the capability to preform the following basic learnng tasks:

Learn the AND boolean expression to an accuracy of 100% in 85 epochs with a learning rate of 1.0 and the use of 2 hidden neurons

Learn the XOR boolean expression to an accuracy of 100% in around 25,000-40,000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 2 hidden neurons. 

Learn to classify digits from the Alpaydin and Kaynakâ€™s Handwritten Digits set to a validation accuracy of around 97% and a testing accuracy of around 96% in 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 150 hidden neurons

Learn to classify digits from the MNIST Handwritten Digits set to a validation accuracy of around 91% in 5 epochs with a learning rate of 0.05 and the use of 150 hidden neurons
